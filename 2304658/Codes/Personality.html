    <h2>My Strongest Traits</h2>
    <h3>Determination</h3>
    <p>Determination plays a vital role in my academic success. When faced with difficult modules, I dedicate extra hours to studying, seek guidance from teachers, and utilize online resources to improve my understanding.  In my career, determination helps me stay committed to my goals, complete tasks efficiently, and push through obstacles to achieve success.</p>
    <h3>Emotion: Resilience</h3>
    <p>Resilience allows me to handle academic setbacks without losing motivation. If I receive a lower grade than expected, I view it as a learning opportunity rather than a failure. Consequently, This emotional strength helps me stay focused, adjust my study strategies, and continuously improve my performance.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

    <h2>My Hero: Nelson Mandela</h2>
    <p>Nelson Mandela is my hero due to his unwavering dedication to justice, equality, and human rights. As a fearless anti-apartheid activist and South Africa’s first Black president (1994–1999), he fought against racial oppression and championed unity and reconciliation. Despite enduring 27 years in prison, he remained committed to peace and democracy, inspiring movements for freedom worldwide. His resilience, leadership, and ability to forgive even his oppressors make him a true symbol of strength and hope. I chose Mandela as my hero because his life teaches the importance of perseverance, compassion, and standing up for what is right, no matter the challenges.

    <h3> Inspirational Quote</h3>
    <p>"One cannot be prepared for something while secretly believing it will not happen."</p>
    <p>True preparation requires both action and belief. If someone prepares for a goal but secretly doubts they can achieve it, their effort will be half-hearted and ineffective. For instance, if you’re studying for an exam but deep down believe you’re going to fail, you might not put in your best effort or approach your studies with confidence. The same goes for training for a competition, if you doubt your ability to win, you won’t push yourself as hard as you could, and you’ll fall short of your full potential.
        In essence, belief shapes effort and true preparation isn’t just about going through the motions; it’s about committing fully. Without belief, preparation lacks real commitment and can even lead to self-sabotage.</p>

    <h2>Personality Test</h2>
    <img src="../Assets/images/personality_test.png" alt="Personality Test Screenshot">
    <p>Reflecting on the results of the Global Personality Test, in terms of general validity, personality tests like this one are based on psychometric models and can provide useful insights into common traits that most people can relate to. The test measures stable traits such as stability, orderliness, and extraversion, which are widely recognized in psychological research. However, it's important to note that no test can capture every variation of an individual’s personality due to the complexity of people, personality can shift depending on context, mood, or environment.
        Looking at the results in my case without bias, I feel that the traits highlighted do resonate with how I see myself, particularly with orderliness and extraversion. I do value organization and responsibility, sometimes to the point where it interferes with my flexibility. The low score for extraversion also aligns with my preference to shy away from large social gatherings. The test captures these tendencies, though I would argue that while I might be reclusive at times, I do engage socially in smaller, meaningful contexts.
        Consequently, the test's representation of my stability and extraversion might feel a bit simplistic. For example, I can be calm and resilient in certain situations, but can also be highly reactive in other traits that are not easily summarized as "medium." This variability suggests that personality traits might not be as fixed as the test implies, and the outcomes can depend on factors like current life circumstances or emotional state.
        In summary, while the test offers useful insights into my general personality, I believe it oversimplifies the complexity of human nature. Personality tests are best used as tools for self-reflection rather than definitive measures of who we are as an individual.
